# Setting up Jenkins and Running a "Hello World" Pipeline

This guide outlines the steps to set up Jenkins, create a pipeline job, and execute a simple "Hello World" pipeline stored in a GitHub repository.

### Prerequisites

- **Jenkins Installed**: Make sure Jenkins is installed on your system or server. You can download it from [here](https://www.jenkins.io/download/).
- **GitHub Repository**: Have a GitHub repository where you'll store your Jenkinsfile.

### Steps

#### 1. Configure Jenkins
- **Install Jenkins**: Follow the installation instructions for your operating system from the [Jenkins website](https://www.jenkins.io/download/).
- **Set up GitHub Integration**: Install necessary Jenkins plugins for GitHub integration. Configure Jenkins to connect with your GitHub account or repository.

#### 2. Create a Pipeline Job
- **Access Jenkins Dashboard**: Open Jenkins in your web browser and log in.
- **Create a New Pipeline Job**: Click on "New Item" or "New Pipeline" and provide a name for your job.
- **Configure Pipeline Settings**: Select "Pipeline" as the job type. Choose Git as your SCM, provide your GitHub repository URL, and specify the Jenkinsfile location.

#### 3. Define the Jenkinsfile
- **Create a Jenkinsfile**: In your GitHub repository, create a file named `Jenkinsfile`.
- **Define the Pipeline**: Inside the `Jenkinsfile`, define a simple "Hello World" pipeline using Groovy syntax.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World!'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### 4. Run the Pipeline
- **Save and Trigger the Pipeline**: Save the Jenkins job configuration. Manually trigger the build by clicking "Build Now" on the job's page in Jenkins.
- **Check Output**: Jenkins will fetch the code from your GitHub repository and execute the pipeline. Check the console output for "Hello World!" printed as part of the pipeline execution.

This README serves as a basic guide to get started with Jenkins pipelines executing a "Hello World" example. Customize it based on your specific setup and requirements.
